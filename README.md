## üåç Carbon Score Assumptions

To estimate the environmental impact, the following carbon scores (in grams of CO‚ÇÇ) are assigned to clothing items:

| Clothing Item | Carbon Score (g CO‚ÇÇ) |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| T-shirt       | 5000                 |
| Jeans         | 10000                |
| Jacket        | 15000                |
| Shoes         | 8000                 |
| Dress         | 12000                |
| Sweater       | 7000                 |
| Shirt         | 6000                 |
| Shorts        | 4000                 |
| Skirt         | 5000                 |
| Coat          | 20000                |

These values are stored in the backend (`carbon_scores.py`) for quick access.

## üåü Product & Technical Enhancements

### Proposed Enhancements

1. **Scaling Backend**:
   - Introduce a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) to handle frequently accessed data.
   - Use a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing user data and transaction history.
   - Deploy using serverless platforms for auto-scaling.

2. **Improved Carbon Scoring**:
   - Incorporate detailed material data and production practices.
   - Integrate external APIs for real-time carbon footprint data.

3. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Add sustainability tips based on detected items.
   - Provide visual comparisons (e.g., CO‚ÇÇ saved vs. industry average).

4. **Advanced Integrations**:
   - Partner with brands to fetch real-world carbon data.
   - Add social sharing features for eco-savings achievements.
